# Slack-CS-Notify
Cobalt Strike Beacon Notify version in Slack using Webhook

I was studying how to create bacon notifications for slack, suddenly my dear friend Daniel Durnea posted this gold mine and made my work easier, full credits to the author b4r0nd3l4b1rr4

## Using:

1) Open your cobalt strike

2) Go to Cobalt Strike > Script Manager

3) Add the slacknotify.cna file

4) Don't forget to modify the notify.py file to pull the webhook you created, preferably keep both scripts in the same folder

Here's a tutorial to create a slack app and a webhook
